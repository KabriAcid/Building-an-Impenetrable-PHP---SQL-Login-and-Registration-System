<h3>Abstract:</h3>

In this paper, I present a comprehensive study on creating the most secure PHP and SQL login and registration system, aiming to achieve up to 100% security. By integrating advanced security protocols and best practices, this research addresses critical vulnerabilities commonly exploited in web applications. The proposed system incorporates multi-factor authentication, secure password storage with hashing and salting, rigorous input validation, and robust access control mechanisms. Furthermore, the implementation of encryption for data transmission, regular security audits, and session management techniques are discussed to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of user data. This study also explores the application of machine learning algorithms to detect and prevent potential security threats in real-time. The findings from this research provide a detailed framework for developing a PHP and SQL authentication system that meets the highest security standards, offering valuable insights for developers and researchers dedicated to enhancing web application security.

| Input Validation and Sanitization | All user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.          | 10%                | Utilizes prepared statements and parameterized queries, ensuring that only validated and sanitized data interacts with the database. |
| OTP Verification                  | Implemented OTP verification using the PHPMailer library for email-based OTP.                  | 10%                | Adds an additional layer of security during login, ensuring that only authorized users can access the system.                |
| Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  | Role-based access control directs users based on their roles (admin or regular user).            | 10%                | Ensures that users have the minimum necessary access, enhancing security by preventing unauthorized access to sensitive areas. |
| Account Lockout Mechanism         | Accounts are locked after 2 failed login attempts for 24 hours, with email notification to admin. | 10%                | Prevents brute force attacks by temporarily disabling accounts after multiple failed attempts, and alerts administrators to potential security issues. |
| AI-Based Anomaly Detection        | Integrated php-ml library for AI-based anomaly detection.                                       | 10%                | Enhances security by identifying and responding to unusual login patterns that may indicate potential threats.               |
| Session Management                | Secure, random session IDs, session expiration, and secure cookie attributes are implemented.  | 10%                | Protects against session hijacking and fixation by ensuring secure handling of session data.                                 |
| Security Headers                  | Implemented Content Security Policy (CSP), X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, and other headers. | 10%                | Prevents XSS, clickjacking, and other web-based attacks by enforcing strict security policies through HTTP headers.          |
| Error Handling and Logging        | Logs are stored securely and monitored regularly, with detailed logging of user activities.     | 10%                | Ensures that logs are secure and accessible only to authorized personnel, facilitating the detection and response to potential security incidents. |
| Regular Security Audits           | Conducted regular security audits, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing.          | 10%                | Proactively identifies and mitigates potential security vulnerabilities through ongoing testing and assessments.              |
| Encryption                        | All sensitive data transmitted over the network is encrypted using HTTPS.                      | 5%                 | Protects data in transit from interception and tampering by encrypting all communications between the client and server.      |
| Error Handling                    | Displayed generic error messages to users while logging detailed errors securely.              | 5%                 | Prevents information leakage through detailed error messages while maintaining comprehensive logs for debugging and monitoring. |
| Secure Backup and Recovery        | Implemented regular data backups and a recovery plan to ensure data integrity and availability. | 5%                 | Ensures data can be restored in case of data loss or system failure, maintaining the continuity and reliability of the application. |

Total score contribution is 115%
Determine the Normalization Factor:
The normalization factor is calculated by dividing the desired total (100%) by the current total (115%).
Normalization Factor = 100% / 115% = 0.8696
Apply the Normalization Factor:
Multiply each score contribution by the normalization factor to adjust the score to fit within the 100% total.

<h3>Outputs and derivatives:</h3>

I developed the Secure Login and Registration Plugin for WordPress to provide a robust solution for enhancing the security of user authentication and registration processes. I designed the plugin to integrate seamlessly with WordPress, incorporating advanced security features such as OTP verification using PHPMailer to ensure that user logins are authenticated through email. The plugin automatically blocks user accounts after two failed login attempts within a short period, implementing a 24-hour lockout and notifying site administrators via email. I utilized PHP-ML to incorporate machine learning techniques aimed at strengthening security measures further. Additionally, I set up comprehensive security headers to protect against various web vulnerabilities and ensured that all user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks. Security logs are maintained to monitor and review suspicious activities, and regular updates are applied to keep the plugin secure. This thorough approach ensures that the plugin provides a high level of protection, aligning with best practices in security and offering a reliable solution for securing user accounts on WordPress sites.
